I ask a lot of questions most of the time to understand the problem at hand. I learned that in order for me to get the answer I'm looking for, it's important to craft the question.

### Be specific
It helps that the question is specific. If the question has a lot of different answers, then the question might be broad. Break the question down, analyze if it be broken down into parts and knowing what you want also helps.

### Arm your question with knowledge
It's important to make sure that you already made an effort researching the material before asking the question. It takes a bit of work to do this but finding out the answer for yourself is rewarding. Googling a question helps, many times, the answer is already online. If you can't google it try using different keywords or a different angle.
