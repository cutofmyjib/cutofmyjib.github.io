What is Rails? What is Ruby on Rails? Rails is a Ruby gem. So Rails is written in Ruby. A Ruby gem is like a library or a plug-in. Ruby is a language designed and developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan! Badass! And Rails is the framework created by David Hansson. A framework provides the code libraries and data structures that helps you do things and more. It's useful to know about web basics, HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript and Ruby to use Rails.

Why use Rails? Well, you want to use it because it helps you make programming web apps easier. It gives you flow control dictation, it has built-in default behaviors that follow best practices. You have less code to maintain.
