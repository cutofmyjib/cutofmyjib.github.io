When we are using functions, we can pass arguments, arguments can be strings, booleans, integers, arrays, etc... they can also be functions, this is called a callback function. A callback acts like a function pointer which is invoked or called back at some point.

Let's take a simple example:

```javascript
function applyCB(string, callback) {
  callback(string)
}
```

Notice that `callback` parameter is not invoked, since it doesn't have the invocation operator (pair of parentheses). Inside `applyCB` is when the callback function is invoked. Also, notice that `callback` has a parameter `string` when it is called.

Let's see it in action!

```javascript
applyCB("Javascript", function(str) {console.log(str + " is awesome!")})
//Javascript is awesome!
```

When applyCB is called, it is passed 2 arguments: string and callback;
string which is **Javascript** and callback which is **function(str) {return str + " is awesome!"}**, notice that this is an anonymous function (a function without a name).

The callback can also be stored as a variable and used as an argument:

```javascript
var isAwesome = function(str) {
  console.log(str + " is awesome!")
}

applyCB("Javascript", isAwesome)
//Javascript is awesome!
```

Understanding callbacks is helpful when using methods that take them as a parameter. It's also important to understand how closures work.

In this example, `obj` has a property called `addPropTo`, which also happens to be a function that takes `array` as a parameter. It uses the map method which takes a callback as a parameter. To see what the map method does, read more about it <a href="js_map.html">here</a>.

```javascript
var obj = {
  prop: "is awesome!",
  addPropTo: function(array) {
    return array.map(function(item) {
      return item + ' ' + this.prop
    }, this)
  }
}

console.log(obj.addPropTo(["Javascript", "Learning"]))
//["Javascript is awesome!", "Learning is awesome!"]
```
Notice that the map method takes 2 parameters, the callback function **function(item) {return item + ' ' + this.prop}** and thisArg **this**, read more about the second optional parameter thisArg <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">here</a>.

Each function call gets it own **this** context. So the callback that is passed as parameter in the map method is looking for it's own `prop`, so we pass a second argument (this) to use as **this** when executing `callback`.

There are different ways of solving the situation above. Read more about it <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_elife.html#p_QcRBGpv5Fi">here</a>.
