When we are using functions, we can pass arguments, arguments can be strings, booleans, integers, arrays, etc... they can also be functions, this is called a callback function.

Let's take a simple example:

```javascript
function applyCB(string, callback) {
  callback(string)
}
```

In the above function, notice that `callback` in the parameter is not called, it doesn't have the invocation operator (pair of parenthesis). Inside `applyCB` is when the callback function is invoked. Also, notice that `callback` has a parameter `string` when it is called.

Let's see it in action!

```javascript
applyCB("Javascript", function(str) {console.log(str + " is awesome!")})
//Javascript is awesome!
```

When applyCB is called, it is passed 2 arguments: string and callback;
string which is **Javascript** and callback which is **function(str) {return str + " is awesome!"}**, notice that this is an anonymous function (a function without a name).

The callback can also be stored as a variable and used as an argument:

```javascript
var isAwesome = function(str) {
  console.log(str + " is awesome!")
}

applyCB("Javascript", isAwesome)
//Javascript is awesome!
```
