Before starting Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, one of the requirements is to take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">thinking style test</a>. According to the results, I mostly think Concrete Random style with a hint of everything.

While I think it's interesting to know what my thinking style falls under, I take it as a grain of salt. True as it may be that I find it difficult for me to get into a routine, deal with formal reports, restrictions and limitations and etc, I like to think that it applies to everybody. To be honest, I have a love-hate relationship with these kinds of tests. I find it borderline horoscope-ish. But that isn't the point of this reflection.

My experience in Phase 0 has been great overall. I could use some help having structure and organization to the day by day objectives I need to learn. I need to plan to maximize my learning because I find some days are more productive than others. I think it's important for me to have <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/11/01/240779578/is-having-grit-the-key-to-success">grit,</a> a growth mindset, and fun while learning.
