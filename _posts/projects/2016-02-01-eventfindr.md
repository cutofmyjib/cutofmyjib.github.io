[eventFindr](https://github.com/cutofmyjib/eventFindr) is a Chrome extension that uses the Eventbrite API to help the user find events in a particular city they want. The user can choose to display events happening during the same week or the next weekend.

## **The look:**
I used Semantic UI for some components such as the event lists. I made a quick logo combining Eventbrite's and a map pin. I found some really cool fonts on Behance, I chose a hand-lettering font and made a quick layout.


## **React:**
I'm still using React for most of my projects. I learned a lot how to implement it in a Chrome extension. I learned how to pass props properly, implementing radio buttons and a lot about how state works and knowing when to use react-router. I'm still scratching the surface but I'm getting better.


## **Extension:**
I'll be uploading eventFindr on Chrome extension you can view or downloaded it on [github](https://github.com/cutofmyjib/eventFindr).
