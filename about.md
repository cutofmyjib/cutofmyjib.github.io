Hi, my name is Diana. I'm a designer and front-end developer living in San Franciscold!

To leverage my design skills and become a front-end developer with knowledge of full-stack, I attended an immersive web development program at Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. At present, I keep learning and bettering these practices by attending hackathons and actively building projects I'm passionate about.
