simple calculator

This is a simple calculator I build with the help of ["Build A Calculator" course on codecademy ](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-intermediate-en-jfhjJ/0/1) 

It is working and some functions are weird like the division operator, it'll return infinity
when a number is divided by 0 =)

Still a work in progress, you can give me some feedback or help me make it better. Thanks!
